    <pre>
            Date and time in JavaScript are represented with the Date object. We can't create “only date” or “only time”: Date objects always carry both.
            Months are counted from zero (yes, January is a zero month).
            Days of week in getDay() are also counted from zero (that's Sunday).
            Date auto-corrects itself when out-of-range components are set. Good for adding/subtracting days/months/hours.
            Dates can be subtracted, giving their difference in milliseconds. That's because a Date becomes the timestamp when converted to a number.
            Use Date.now() to get the current timestamp fast.

        // function getWeekDay(date) {
        //     let days = ['SU', 'MO', 'TU', 'WE', 'TH', 'FR', 'SA'];

        //     return days[date.getDay()];
        // }

        // let date = new Date(2023, 8, 5);

        function getDateAgo(date, days) {
            let dateCopy = new Date(date);

            dateCopy.setDate(date.getDate() - days);
            return dateCopy.getDate();
        }

        let date = new Date(2023, 8, 5);

        alert(getDateAgo(date, 1)); 
        alert(getDateAgo(date, 2)); 
        alert(getDateAgo(date, 365));
